                HouseLedger was designed to make the pesky process of splitting bills easier! Just enter the information the items and costs from
                any receipt to split, and users can opt in/out of items. HouseLedger then splits the costs of these items among the participating members to balance
                costs.

                HouseLedger was thought up by my housemates and I back in 2022 when we moved into our college house. We wanted to be able to split groceries,
                but we all liked different things and did not think it was fair to have everyone pay for everyone else's things all the time, despite us sharing a majority of the
                groceries. We created a series of Excel worksheets that solved this problem of splitting costs, but HouseLedger gives that system a facelift as the web interface
                version of our cost-splitting solution.
